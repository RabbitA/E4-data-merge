# E4-data-merge-tool

This is a small tool to merge CSV files with different sampling rate from E4 online system. Made for fun, and its very useful and powerful if you want to do some research with E4 sensors. It provides an interface for users. After installed JRE, just drop this jar into your folder and double click it or input "~$ java -jar E4csvMerge.jar" in terminal. 

Enjoy!
